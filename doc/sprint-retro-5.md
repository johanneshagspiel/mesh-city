# Sprint retrospective for sprint 4
### June 1, 2020
This week we realized our requirements required more realism and focus: they were both ambitious and did not always match the end-goal of this project and what is important to the client. Every task should serve the end-goal, and the most important tasks should be done first. Our workflow as a group has improved a bit this week, with a more feature based workflow, but as this retrospective was written up, Johannes voiced his concern that he felt like he and to an extent Wouter were carrying the brunt of implementing features while the others, Borna, Thom and Reinout were spending a lot of time doing a little bit of everything from code quality/reviewing to working on prototypes for feature detection but not contributing significantly towards getting the actual requirements done. In the discussion that followed, eventually consensus was reached that while the latter three should contribute more actively towards getting these requirements done (Staying focused, as was mentioned by Frank in the midterm meeting), their comparatively low output is understandable given given that when one person writes a lot of quickly finished code this definitely clogs the pipeline that is scrum and detracts from other people's productivity. This discussion all in all felt quite empowering as we found out that this problem was also the reason that these big multi-feature branches kept cropping up. 
As there were two big feedback moments this week, this external feedback is described in a seperate midterm reflection document.

When this sprint is compared to last, there is one big improvement, namely that there is now at the end of the sprint not a very large unfinished feature branch as was the case last week. We also noticed that it is hard to trace tasks to sprints in the current overview, although we reached consensus the sprint was done remembering the tasks we picked. We are currently at 52% test coverage, which we think is enough for a proof-of-concept type of program like our own. It might be that we can improve this if time is left at the end of the project, but we do not feel like this is important to the client. It was noted that not everyone is there at the time we plan meetings, initially it was noted that Johannes has been calling in late often but he correctly pointed out that in this project some people have even skipped a few meetings which he hasn't done up to this date. We could not get the CI pipeline to work as the way we store our dependencies in our virtual environment requires the dependencies to be downloaded in CI, and as this cannot be passed along, we have decided to rely on running quality checks locally for now using the setup we have that runs testing, formatting and linting.
