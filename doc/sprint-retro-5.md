# Sprint retrospective for sprint 5
### June 8, 2020

This week the team mostly focused on completing all of the must-haves, and although not fully finalized we were almost successful in that task. All must-haves besides object-swapping were completed, but they are still not fully merged in the develop branch at the end of the sprint. The reason why this has occurred, is that the team spent some time refactoring some code to allow for better future integration and overall better code quality. This refactoring while necessary took longer than expected.
One other observation was that we spent less time discussing in our meetings and got more done, which was one of our goals from previous sprints. The team felt like they were overall more productive this week, and while we talked less this did not hurt our communication.
