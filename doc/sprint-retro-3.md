# Sprint retrospective for sprint 3
### May 25, 2020
In this week we were faced by the reality that if you do not look after your code quality when you first begin, you will have a difficult time upholding code quality standards after. As we did not follow a proper feature-based workflow in the first sprint, some of the fundamental entities in our program needed to be refactored and new features depended on such reworkings. In the end this resulted in there being a huge merge request at the end of the week, namely friday, unreviewed. Although what is different this week is that many merge requests have been reviewed and merged into develop in a reasonable manner, this still means that effectively the sprint was not done in time yet, as by far the largest amount of work has still to be merged into develop.

In the beginning, the big branch was a significant refactor branch. The demo we wrote up for the client depended on it, but instead of branching off we worked on it the same branch. So then it was a significant refactor plus a lot of unfinished demo features. At this point, it was already far too large. Although the client was very happy with the demo, we should from now on only show what is down by our own standards, namely that everything is tested (70%), formatted etc. One thing that came up is that we should remember that whenever you work on a feature, you will probably need as much time as you spent implementing on testing.

One thing that we should remember during planning is that there were free days this week, on which many people did not work on the project for the entire day.  

CI pipeline is not working yet, we think that if this is finally working.
