# Sprint retrospective for sprint 3
## May 25, 2020

Last week we noticed that we were working towards a good workflow by using feature branches and code review before merging into develop, and that a task board to match the user stories really helped us decouple what we were working on. This week we continued that trend and also focused on improving our test coverage, as we were at about 50% 
We also noticed however, that the sprint was far from done with no substantial work being merged into develop and code quality lacking significantly.
