# Sprint retrospective for sprint 2
## May 18, 2020

Progress has been made in terms of the project itself and our process. User stories have been translated to tasks on Wednesday and as a result work people are doing is much less coupled, resulting in a much better workflow. The sprint is not done however, the task merge requests being up on GitLab without having been reviewed. This is quite understandable however seeing that we changed the workflow completely on Wednesday and have accumulated quite a bit of technical debt by merging all our work into the development branch without serious quality checks (as many things were changing all the time writing things like tests and documentation were neglected). Progress has been made on improving the code quality and getting the existing code to an acceptable level is something we will focus on in the next sprint. 

While we have adopted a task-based workflow, we noticed that our tasks were 'done' in terms of functionality by Friday, which was followed by the weekend (in which nobody reviews anything) meaning that by Monday we had formally not finished anything. As a first step towards a workflow in which code reviews play a big part, we have decided that tasks should be finished before Friday such that this day, which we noticed is not our most productive day, can serve as the day we review and wrap up the week's sprint and show what we worked on to the client. This is to ensure that no work remains after the weekend and the next sprint will be done by Monday.

Another thing we noticed is that we often have long meetings with few breaks. As these are all conducted as video-calls because of the pandemic, many people in our group find these very taxing. Therefore we have decided to try to make our meeting more efficient by having somebody lead the discussion and by taking a 5-minute break after 30 minutes of discussion. We also expect that once our workflow is working as it should (e.g. no technical debt like we have it right now, smaller merge requests etc.) long meetings will become much rarer as it is much clearer to everyone what has to be done without requiring excessive coordination.
